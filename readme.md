# INTRODUCTION

The StepperMotor library is designed to simplify the control of stepper motors using the ULN2003APG Driver with Arduino. It provides an easy-to-use interface for moving stepper motors forward or backward for a specified duration at varying speeds. This library includes features such as setting acceleration and deceleration rates, making it versatile for different stepper motor applications.

## Features

- Control stepper motors with ULN2003APG Driver
- Move motors forward or backward for a specified duration
- Set acceleration and deceleration rates for smoother motion

For usage instructions and examples, please refer to the README.md file.
